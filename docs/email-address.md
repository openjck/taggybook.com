# Email addresses

On this website, I point visitors to my personal email address.

It might be more professional to point visitors to an email address like
info@taggybook.com, but as of 2021-05-02, Namecheap's free email redirection
service does not redirect any email which has a ZIP attached. I doubt that many
people would attach a ZIP in their correspondence, but it could happen.
Therefore, I'd rather just point to my personal email address directly.
